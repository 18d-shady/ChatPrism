# Project ChatPrism
	A very interesting chat app built for remote work

## Project Detail:

Develop a web app (more like a google meet clone:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:) that  help people chat, talk, connect and collaborate without language barrier

As such, it will leverage on some of the google cloud products and services, e.g. Speech-to-Text, etc.
We will build a web user interface around it.

### Key features:

- support more than one language
- users connect using only audio

### Tools and skills needed:

- frontend devs
- backend devs
- google cloud products/services


## Problems Solved:

1. Help to make communication easy between individuals from different parts with different languages. 

2. Improve Communication skills and confidence of individuals while they are comfortable speaking the language they know best 

3. Remove communication barrier (like needing a translator) and help people communicate easier.

4. Solve the issues of data consumption that puts people off using Zoom, and improve on the issue of "no avenue to provide feedback" that limits Mixlr usage
